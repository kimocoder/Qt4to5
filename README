This tool ports from Qt 4 to Qt 5.

If the proper developement packages are install this plugin can be compiled with out being the
clang source tree. However this does not always work out-of-the-box on kubuntu. Clang and llvm binaries
must also be install. The fallowing are needed:
  clang/llvm 4.0.x
  libclang - A seprate package for my distro.
  All developement headers for the above. This inteaded to build outside the clang/llvm source tree.

I don't like depending a specific version but the clang/llvm developers donot garentee abi compatiblity
between versions beyond minor bugfix releases.

For kubuntu you will needed to do:
dpkg-divert --divert /usr/lib/llvm-4.0/cmake/ClangConfig.cmake --rename /usr/share/llvm-4.0/cmake/ClangConfig.cmake
dpkg-divert --divert /usr/lib/llvm-4.0/cmake/ClangTargets.cmake --rename /usr/share/llvm-4.0/cmake/ClangTargets.cmake
dpkg-divert --divert /usr/lib/llvm-4.0/cmake/ClangTargets-relwithdebinfo.cmake --rename /usr/share/llvm-4.0/cmake/ClangTargets-relwithdebinfo.cmake

These files are not installed to the right place by default. 

To build it:

  git clone https://github.com/reporter123/Qt4to5 qt4to5
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  make

To run it, edit and run the portqt4to5.py script.
